Hi, i'm Andreas and this is the Git-Repo belonging to my Bachelor's Thesis. If you find something usefull feel free to get inspired.

Please excuse the lack of comments in some sections of my code. Since this was a one-man project that had to be done in a short amount of time, i neglected to write a detailed documentation and comments.

Files with Training-Data are missing due to GitHubs limit for size of files. Trained Models are also not included.
